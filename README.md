            model_68900.data-00000-of-00001
            model_68900.index
        So parameter 'model_path' should be set to '{current directory}\model_68900'
    sr_or_os: Option:sr,os. If your purpose is image super-resolution, you should select 'sr',
    conversely, you should select 'os'. But it's important to note, parameter 'sr_or_os' and 'model_path' should be corresponding.

Double-click *main.exe* to run, a cmd window will pop up and print the output text during the executive process.
